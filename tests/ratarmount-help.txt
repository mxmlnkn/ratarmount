                     mount_source [mount_source ...] [mount_point]

With ratarmount, you can:
  - Mount a (compressed) TAR file to a folder for read-only access
  - Mount a compressed file to `<mountpoint>/<filename>`
  - Bind mount a folder to another folder for read-only access
  - Union mount a list of TARs, compressed files, and folders to a mount point
    for read-only access

Optional Arguments:
  --password PASSWORD   Specify a single password which shall be used for RAR and ZIP files.
                        (default: )
  -P PARALLELIZATION, --parallelization PARALLELIZATION
                        If an integer other than 1 is specified, then the threaded parallel
                        bzip2 decoder will be used specified amount of block decoder threads.
                        Further threads with lighter work may be started. A value of 0 will use
                        all the available cores (24). (default: 0)
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
  -r, --recursive       Mount archives inside archives recursively. Same as --recursion-depth
                        -1. (default: False)
  -u, --unmount         Unmount the given mount point. Equivalent to calling "fusermount -u".
                        (default: False)
  -v, --version         Print version information and exit.

Positional Options:
  mount_source          The path to the TAR archive to be mounted. If multiple archives and/or
                        folders are specified, then they will be mounted as if the arguments
                        coming first were updated with the contents of the archives or folders
                        specified thereafter, i.e., the list of TARs and folders will be union
                        mounted.
  mount_point           The path to a folder to mount the TAR contents into. If no mount path is
                        specified, the TAR will be mounted to a folder of the same name but
                        without a file extension. (default: None)

Index Options:
  --index-file INDEX_FILE
                        Specify a path to the .index.sqlite file. Setting this will disable
                        fallback index folders. If the given path is ":memory:", then the index
                        will not be written out to disk. (default: None)
  --index-folders INDEX_FOLDERS
                        Specify one or multiple paths for storing .index.sqlite files. Paths
                        will be tested for suitability in the given order. An empty path will be
                        interpreted as the location in which the TAR resides. If the argument
                        begins with a bracket "[", then it will be interpreted as a JSON-
                        formatted list. If the argument contains a comma ",", it will be
                        interpreted as a comma-separated list of folders. Else, the whole string
                        will be interpreted as one folder path. Examples: --index-folders
                        ",~/.foo" will try to save besides the TAR and if that does not work, in
                        ~/.foo. --index-folders '["~/.ratarmount", "foo,9000"]' will never try
                        to save besides the TAR. --index-folder ~/.ratarmount will only test
                        ~/.ratarmount as a storage location and nothing else. Instead, it will
                        first try ~/.ratarmount and the folder "foo,9000". (default:
                        ,/home/hypatia/.cache/ratarmount,~/.ratarmount)
  --verify-mtime        By default, only the TAR file size is checked to match the one in the
                        found existing ratarmount index. If this option is specified, then also
                        check the modification timestamp. But beware that the mtime might change
                        during copying or downloading without the contents changing. So, this
                        check might cause false positives. (default: False)
  -c, --recreate-index  If specified, pre-existing .index files will be deleted and newly
                        created. (default: False)

Recursion Options:
  --recursion-depth RECURSION_DEPTH
                        This option takes precedence over --recursive. Mount archives inside the
                        mounted archives recursively up to the given depth. A negative value
                        represents infinite depth. A value of 0 will turn off recursion (same as
                        not specifying --recursive in the first place). A value of 1 will
                        recursively mount all archives in the given archives but not any deeper.
                        Note that this only has an effect when creating an index. If an index
                        already exists, then this option will be effectively ignored. Recreate
                        the index if you want change the recursive mounting policy anyways.
                        (default: None)
  --transform-recursive-mount-point REGEX_PATTERN REPLACEMENT
                        Specify a regex pattern and a replacement string, which will be applied
                        via Python's re module to the full path of the archive to be recursively
                        mounted. E.g., if there are recursive archives: /folder/archive.tar.gz,
                        you can substitute '[.][^/]+$' to '' and it will be mounted to
                        /folder/archive.tar. Or you can replace '^.*/([^/]+).tar.gz$' to '/' to
                        mount all recursive folders under the top-level without extensions.
                        (default: None)
  -l, --lazy            When used with recursively bind-mounted folders, TAR files inside the
                        mounted folder will only be mounted on first access to it. (default:
                        False)
  -s, --strip-recursive-tar-extension
                        If true, then recursively mounted TARs named <file>.tar will be mounted
                        at <file>/. This might lead to folders of the same name being
                        overwritten, so use with care. The index needs to be (re)created to
                        apply this option! (default: False)

Tar Options:
  --detect-gnu-incremental
                        If specified, will automatically try to detect GNU tar incremental files
                        and, if so, will strip octal modification prefixes. Note that this is
                        only a heuristic derived by testing 1000-10000 file entries. If you are
                        sure it is an incremental TAR, use --gnu-incremental instead. (default:
                        False)
  --gnu-incremental     Will strip octal modification time prefixes from file paths, which
                        appear in GNU incremental backups created with GNU tar with the
                        --incremental or --listed-incremental options. (default: False)
  --no-gnu-incremental  If specified, will never strip octal modification prefixes and will also
                        not do automatic detection. (default: False)
  -e ENCODING, --encoding ENCODING
                        Specify an input encoding used for file names among others in the TAR.
                        This must be used when, e.g., trying to open a latin1 encoded TAR on an
                        UTF-8 system. Possible encodings:
                        https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings
                        (default: utf-8)
  -i, --ignore-zeros    Ignore zeroed blocks in archive. Normally, two consecutive 512-blocks
                        filled with zeroes mean EOF and ratarmount stops reading after
                        encountering them. This option instructs it to read further and is
                        useful when reading archives created with the -A option. (default:
                        False)

Write Overlay Options:
  --commit-overlay      Apply deletions and content modifications done in the write overlay to
                        the archive. (default: False)
  -w WRITE_OVERLAY, --write-overlay WRITE_OVERLAY
                        Specify an existing folder to be used as a write overlay. The folder
                        itself will be union-mounted on top such that files in this folder take
                        precedence over all other existing ones. Furthermore, all file creations
                        and modifications will be forwarded to files in this folder. Modifying a
                        file inside a TAR will copy that file to the overlay folder and apply
                        the modification to that writable copy. Deleting files or folders will
                        update the hidden metadata database inside the overlay folder. (default:
                        None)

Advanced Options:
  --disable-union-mount
                        Mounts all specified archives in equally named subfolders under the
                        mount point. (default: False)
  --index-minimum-file-count INDEX_MINIMUM_FILE_COUNT
                        Create indexes for archives with fewer than this limit of files in
                        memory instead of creating a .index.sqlite file. This is currently not
                        applied for TAR files because the file count only becomes known after
                        parsing the archive, for which an index is already created. (default:
                        1000)
  --oss-attributions    Show licenses of used libraries.
  --password-file PASSWORD_FILE
                        Specify a file with newline separated passwords for RAR and ZIP files.
                        The passwords will be tried out in order of appearance in the file.
                        (default: )
  --transform REGEX_PATTERN REPLACEMENT
                        Specify a regex pattern and a replacement string, which will be applied
                        via Python's re module to the full paths of all archive files. (default:
                        None)
  --union-mount-cache-max-depth UNION_MOUNT_CACHE_MAX_DEPTH
                        Maximum number of folder levels to descend for building the union mount
                        cache. (default: 1024)
  --union-mount-cache-max-entries UNION_MOUNT_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES
                        Maximum number of paths before stopping to descend into subfolders when
                        building the union mount cache. (default: 100000)
  --union-mount-cache-timeout UNION_MOUNT_CACHE_TIMEOUT
                        Timeout in seconds before stopping to build the union mount cache.
                        (default: 60)
  --use-backend USE_BACKEND
                        Specify a backend to be used with higher priority for files which might
                        be opened with multiple backends. Arguments specified last will have the
                        highest priority. A comma-separated list may be specified. Possible
                        backends: ['indexed_gzip', 'indexed_zstd', 'libarchive', 'lzmaffi',
                        'rapidgzip', 'rarfile', 'xz', 'zipfile'] (default: None)
  -d DEBUG, --debug DEBUG
                        Sets the debugging level. Higher means more output. Currently, 3 is the
                        highest. (default: 1)
  -f, --foreground      Keeps the python program in foreground so it can print debug output when
                        the mounted path is accessed. (default: False)
  -gs GZIP_SEEK_POINT_SPACING, --gzip-seek-point-spacing GZIP_SEEK_POINT_SPACING
                        This only is applied when the index is first created or recreated with
                        the -c option. The spacing given in MiB specifies the seek point
                        distance in the uncompressed data. A distance of 16MiB means that
                        archives smaller than 16MiB in uncompressed size will not benefit from
                        faster seek times. A seek point takes roughly 32kiB. So, smaller
                        distances lead to more responsive seeking but may explode the index
                        size! (default: 16)
  -o FUSE, --fuse FUSE  Comma separated FUSE options. See "man mount.fuse" for help. Example:
                        --fuse "allow_other,entry_timeout=2.8,gid=0". (default: )
  -p PREFIX, --prefix PREFIX
                        [deprecated] Use "-o modules=subdir,subdir=<prefix>" instead. This
                        standard way utilizes FUSE itself and will also work for other FUSE
                        applications. So, it is preferable even if a bit more verbose.The
                        specified path to the folder inside the TAR will be mounted to root.
                        This can be useful when the archive as created with absolute paths.
                        E.g., for an archive created with `tar -P cf /var/log/apt/history.log`,
                        -p /var/log/apt/ can be specified so that the mount target directory
                        >directly< contains history.log. (default: )
