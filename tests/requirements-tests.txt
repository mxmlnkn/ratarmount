# Many of these packages, such as pytype, twine, ... depend on cryptography >= 39, which in a manylinux2010_x86_64
# container fails to install because of:
#   Python 3.6: the cp36-abi3 wheel is not downloaded by pip 22 because the oldest one is for manylinux_2_17.
#   Python 3.7: missing ffi.h when building cffi from source.
#    -> Run 'apt install libffi-dev' or 'yum install -y libffi-devel'.
# Even after that it fails to fucking install because of:
# Collecting cryptography>=39.0 (from asyncssh->-r r.txt (line 24))
#   Using cached cryptography-45.0.3.tar.gz (744 kB)
