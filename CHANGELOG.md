# Version 0.12.0 built on 2022-06-xx

 - Add --recursion-depth argument for more fine-grained recursion control.
 - (ratarmountcore 0.4.0) AutoMountLayer now takes a 'recursionDepth' argument instead of 'recursive'.

 - Add --write-overlay option to enable write support at the mount point.
 - Add -u option for more consistent mount/unmount call signatures.
 - Add output for versions of all dependencies to --version.
 - Add support for AppImage builds which will be offered on the GitHub Releases page.
 - Add --transform-recursive-mount-point option to control the mount path of recursively mounted archives.
 - Change default for --parallelization from 1 to 0, i.e., maximum number of cores.
 - (ratarmountcore 0.2.1) Fix (the last 1000) files not showing for truncated / incomplete TAR files.
 - (ratarmountcore 0.2.2) Improve performance for gzip files significantly by using a larger buffer.
 - (ratarmountcore 0.2.2) Do not use ParallelXZReader for single-block xz files to avoid memory issues.
 - (ratarmountcore 0.2.3) Fix uncaught exception when a folder contains an invalid character.
 - (ratarmountcore 0.2.4) Recursive mounting of nested uncompressed TARs did skip some files for depth > 2.
 - (ratarmountcore 0.3.0) Relax the check for GNU incremental TAR detection because the prefix field
   might contain binary data.
 - (ratarmountcore 0.3.0) Improve performance by factor ~5 and avoid storage requirements for index
   reading for gzip compressed archives.
 - (ratarmountcore 0.3.0) Improve performance by ~40% and avoid storage requirements for index
   writing for gzip compressed archives.
 - (ratarmountcore 0.3.0) Improve performance for indexing uncompressed TARs that have been
   appended to by only analyzing the new files.
 - (ratarmountcore 0.3.0) Fix uncompressed archives having been appended very small files (<10 KiB)
   were not detected as changed by default.
 - (ratarmountcore 0.3.0) Fix problem triggered by combining --recursive and -P 0 with a recursive bzip2 archive.

# Version 0.10.0 built on 2022-01-15

 - Split ratarmount into ratarmount, which contains the CLI, and ratarmountcore.
 - Migrate to setup.cfg and pyproject.toml for distribution to pip.
 - Add support for GNU incremental TAR file format.
 - Improve performance by returning file attributes in the readdir FUSE call to avoid
   hundreds of subsequent calls. This improves performance of `find` and others by factor 8 in some tests.
 - Improve performance for large Union Mounts by keeping a path cache for read-only mount sources. This way,
   each FUSE getattr only has to query mount sources known to have the file instead of iterating over all of them.
   Note that the old union cache backported to 0.9.2 was accidentally not actually used and would be buggy anyway.
   This will not be backported to 0.9.x.
 - Improve performance of index creation for uncompressed TARs by batching SQLite index insertions among others.
 - Fixed progress indicator not working for XZ files when using the python-xz backend.
 - Add elapsed time output to progress indicator.
 - Depend on python-xz 0.4.0 to fix runaway memory usage for large files.
 - Parallelize XZ decoder backend for huge speedups for mounting and reading large files inside the mount point.

# Version 0.9.3 built on 2021-12-21

 - Fix mounting of TAR fails if there are special characters like '#' in the path.

   because of the shared underlying file object.

# Version 0.9.2 built on 2021-11-28

 - Fix StenciledFile accidentally throwing an exception when accessing empty files.
 - Improve performance when using union mounting by using a folder-to-archive lookup cache.
 - Implicitly added parent folders will now show a size of 0B instead of arbitrary 1B.
 - Fix version ordering for implicitly added folders.
 - Fix permissions to not remove write permissions. FUSE will still return a
   "Read-only file system" error when trying to modify the file system.
 - Fix RAR files were not found when ratarmount was daemonized and changed the current working directory.

# Version 0.9.1 built on 2021-09-26

   TARs inside the source folder will be mounted only after the first access to it through the mount point.
 - TARs containing hard links to files with exactly the same name will be interpreted as referring
   to a prior version of that file.
